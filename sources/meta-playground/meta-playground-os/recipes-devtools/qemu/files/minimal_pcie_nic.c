 * minimal_pcie_nic.c
 *
 * Minimal skeleton PCIe NIC-like device for QEMU 9.2.0
 * with a PCIe MMIO BAR (BAR0) and read/write callbacks.
 *
 * ─── PCIe NIC in QEMU — Conceptual Overview ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A PCIe NIC in QEMU is composed of three main pillars:
 *
 *  1. PCI CONFIG SPACE
 *     Every PCI device has a 256-byte (PCIe: 4 KB) configuration space visible
 *     to the host OS.  It contains Vendor/Device IDs, class codes, BAR base
 *     addresses, capability pointers (MSI, MSI-X, PCIe), and command/status
 *     registers.  The guest OS reads this during enumeration (lspci) and uses
 *     it to identify and configure the device.
 *
 *  2. BARs (Base Address Registers) — MMIO windows
 *     BARs are regions of memory (or I/O port space) that the device exposes
 *     to the guest.  The guest OS programs BAR base addresses during PCI
 *     enumeration.  When the guest reads/writes into a BAR window, QEMU
 *     intercepts the access and calls the registered MemoryRegionOps
 *     (.read/.write callbacks).  No real RAM is allocated — the BAR is a
 *     virtual trap window backed by our callback logic.
 *
 *     BAR0 (this device): 4 KB MMIO — device registers (RX ring config, etc.)
 *     BAR1 (this device): 4 KB      — MSI-X table + PBA (Pending Bit Array)
 *
 *  3. INTERRUPTS — MSI / MSI-X
 *     Legacy PCI uses a shared INTx wire.  PCIe devices use MSI (Message
 *     Signalled Interrupts) or MSI-X.  Both work by writing a magic value to a
 *     magic address in host memory — no wire needed.  MSI-X extends MSI by
 *     storing per-vector address/data pairs in a table inside BAR1, allowing
 *     up to 2048 independent interrupt vectors.  QEMU's msix_notify() emulates
 *     this by injecting the interrupt directly into the guest.
 *
 * ─── RX Data Path (packet guest-ward) ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  Host network (tap/user) → minimal_receive_packet()
 *    → read RX descriptor from guest memory via pci_dma_read()
 *    → DMA packet bytes into guest buffer via pci_dma_write()
 *    → mark descriptor RX_DONE, advance ring head
 *    → raise MSI-X vector 0 to notify the guest driver
 *
 * ─── Key QEMU Concepts Used ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  memory_region_init_io()  — creates a virtual MMIO trap window (no RAM)
 *  pci_register_bar()       — binds a MemoryRegion to a BAR slot
 *  msix_init()              — allocates MSI-X capability in config space
 *  msix_notify()            — injects an MSI-X interrupt into the guest
 *  pci_dma_read/write()     — DMA between device and guest RAM (IOMMU-aware)
 *  qemu_new_nic()           — connects device to QEMU's net backend (tap, etc.)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - BAR0 exposes a 4 KB MMIO region to the guest
 * - MMIO accesses are trapped and handled by callbacks
 * - memory_region_init_io(..., 0x1000) does NOT allocate 4 KB memory
 *   → It only creates a 0x1000 address window the guest can access
 * - The actual storage backing reads/writes is regs[] (64 bytes)

 *   allocates a contiguous block of vectors in the guest's interrupt table.
 *
 * MSIX_NUM_VECTORS — number of MSI-X vectors.  Each has its own entry in the
 *   MSI-X table (stored in BAR1) with an independent address/data pair.
 *
 * MSIX_BAR_SIZE    — size of BAR1.  Must be large enough for:
 *   - MSI-X table: MSIX_NUM_VECTORS × 16 bytes  (at offset 0x000)
 *   - PBA:         ceil(MSIX_NUM_VECTORS/64) × 8 bytes  (at offset 0x800)
 *
 * MSIX_ENABLE      — compile-time switch: defined → use MSI-X,

 *   nentries       — number of MSI-X vectors (MSIX_NUM_VECTORS = 4)
 *   table_bar      — MemoryRegion that will hold the vector table
 *   table_bar_nr   — BAR index of table_bar (BAR1_MSIX_IDX = 1)

 *  Step 3 — Read the descriptor from guest memory via pci_dma_read().
 *            The descriptor tells us the guest buffer address (desc.addr)
 *            where the packet should be placed.
 *            pci_dma_read() is IOMMU-aware: if the guest uses an IOMMU the
 *            address is translated transparently.
 *
 *  Step 4 — DMA the packet payload into the guest buffer via pci_dma_write().
 *            This is the actual "DMA transfer" — bytes flow from QEMU's heap
 *            into guest RAM at the address the driver prepared.
 *
 *  Step 5 — Update the descriptor: set len = packet size, set flags = RX_DONE.
 *            Write the updated descriptor back to guest memory so the driver
 *            can poll or be interrupted to find the completed entry.
 *
 *  Step 6 — Advance rx_head modulo rx_ring_size (ring wrap-around).
 *
 *  Step 7 — Fire MSI-X vector 0 to notify the guest driver that a new packet
 *            is available.  The driver's ISR will scan the ring for RX_DONE
 *            descriptors and hand the buffers to the network stack.
 *
 * Returns the number of bytes consumed (== size on success, 0 on drop).
